<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic">This is a card game that I used to play during my childhood and I created an online version for my Project 1 of Software Engineering course. </p>

## How to Play

[Click here to play the game](https://rashmika13.github.io/Luck-By-Chance/)

- Shuffle deck to start
- When indicated each player takes turn to flip a card from the deck
- To play again click shuffle deck

## How to Win

When the active player has a matching card value ( value K = value K ) with the opponent the active player wins !

<p style="font-size:15pt;font-style:italic">Moving forward...</p>

I would like to add more features to the game such as- each time the card value matches for the active player , all cards played thus far get added to its deck and the game continues until there are no cards left in one of the decks.
